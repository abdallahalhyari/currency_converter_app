**The state management and the pattern design :**
 -why bloc ??
  Separation of Concerns: By separating the business logic from the UI, the code becomes more organized and easier to manage.
  Reusability: BLoC components can be reused across different parts of the application.
  Testability: Since the business logic is separated, it can be easily tested without depending on the UI.
 -why bloc pattern ??
  The BLoC pattern is a powerful approach to managing state in Flutter applications. By separating business logic from the UI, it promotes a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. Implementing the BLoC pattern involves creating streams and sinks to handle data flow, making the application more responsive and easy to test. As you build more complex applications, adopting the BLoC pattern can significantly improve your code's structure and maintainability.
