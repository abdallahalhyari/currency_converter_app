**The state management and the pattern design :**<br />
**why bloc ??**<br />
  -Separation of Concerns: By separating the business logic from the UI, the code becomes more organized and easier to manage.<br />
  -Reusability: BLoC components can be reused across different parts of the application.<br />
  -Testability: Since the business logic is separated, it can be easily tested without depending on the UI.<br />
 **why bloc pattern ??**<br />
  -The BLoC pattern is a powerful approach to managing state in Flutter applications. By separating business logic from the UI, it promotes a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. <br/>
  -Implementing the BLoC pattern involves creating streams and sinks to handle data flow. <br/>
  -making the application more responsive and easy to test. As you build more complex applications.<br/> 
  -adopting the BLoC pattern can significantly improve your code's structure and maintainability.<br/>


**pre-build the app :**<br/>
  Set Up Your Development Environment<br/>
    1- Install Flutter SDK<br/>

      Add the Flutter bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable.<br/>
   3- Install an Editor<br/>
      Install an IDE that supports Flutter, such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.<br/>
   4- Install Flutter and Dart Plugins <br/>
  For Visual Studio Code:<br/>
   Go to Extensions and install the Flutter and Dart plugins.<br/>
